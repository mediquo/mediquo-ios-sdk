# MediQuoSDK

Welcome to MediQuoSDK for Apple Platforms,  the easiest way to integrate the MediQuo functionality into your app!

**Note:** If you are coming from one of the versions of the SDK previous to the v10.0 release, then this is a breaking change and you should delete all the integration you had before. 

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 15 Deployment Target

## Installation

- Go to your Xcode Project and add the package `https://github.com/mediquo/mediquo-ios-sdk.git` and add the Package to your app.

## Integration

In order to integrate the SDK, we support both UIKit-based apps (the ones with `AppDelegate` and `SceneDelegate`) and SwiftUI-bases apps (the ones with `@main` and `WindowGroup`)
